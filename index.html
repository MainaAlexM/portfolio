               <p> Being a software engineer has been my dream since high school. A famous quote by <span id="Bob"><em>Bob Marley</em></span> states that "No Man is an Island." As the saying goes, my self-taught phase had to come to an end if i needed to be an industry-productive developer. I therefore joined Moringa school after securing a chance there and started my journey in learning software development from January 2022. I have to confess that in less than a month's time, I had learned more than I had done in the previous year. By now, I believe that everyone can make the change.</p>
